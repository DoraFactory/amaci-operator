# aMACI operator

The aMACI operator service is a unique feature offered by the Dora Factory Anonymous MACI protocol (aMACI). Running an aMACI operator means that you will run and tally an aMACI round for a community, and validate the round with zero-knowledge proofs.
From the protocol's [frontend](https://vota.dorafactory.org/), users will be able to create aMACI rounds and select an aMACI operator.
